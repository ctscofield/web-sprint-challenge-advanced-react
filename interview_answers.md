# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

    The main differences between the two is that its SO much easier to manipulate and keep track of state in the stateful component.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

    A componentWillMount function gets called when a page renders/refreshes, and a componentWillUpdate is called when their changes made to props or state.

3. Define stateful logic.

    Stateful logic is any function/component/class or other code that uses state to keep track of data.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

    The three steps of a successful test are Arrange, Act, and Assert. 
    In the Arrange step we make sure that what we are testing renders. 
    In the Act step we look throught the DOM for specific pieces of data that is expected to render.
    In the Assert step we check to make sure that piece of data that was searched for in the Act step rendered.
